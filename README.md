# CS230-The-Gaming-Room-Design

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The Gaming Room was a hypothetical client that wanted to develop web based games for multiple platforms. These games were based on a current game they had developed for the Android App. They wanted to extend the development of this game to other operating platforms (such as Windows and Linux) and wanted me to help them through the design, planning and implementation of this process.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I felt that I had done a good job analyzing the pros and cons of using each operating system for a web host service. I was able to determine based on  the client's requirements they would need to utilize a Linux OS for their applications. I also felt that I did a good job analyzing the business/technical requirements of the client as well as the design constraints this app would face when being implemented.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

Having a framework to use for the overall process helps to see how each part of the code is related to the system as a whole. Understanding client requirements and goals allows you to take into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to solve the problem as well as different programming languages/frameworks that could be used to tackle the problem. It helped to narrow down which OS would be best for the client to use to suit their web hosting needs.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

The UML diagrams could have been explained a bit better. Some of the parts could have been more elaborated on in the design document. Some of the inheritance methods from the Entity class were not properly documented in the UML diagram for the child classes. These needed to be tweaked and fixed. Evaluating the various OS on the client side also could have been improved upon. Due to a misunderstanding in the requirements, the client side section did not appropriately elaborate on what client requirements would be needed for each OS. Much of the client requirements were actually server side requirements. I needed to elaborate more on what requirements would pertain to the client side such as discussing the cost to build and test an application that runs in different browsers on each platform.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

The user is one of the most important aspects to keep in mind when developing a program. If the user does not have a positive experience with the program or it fails to solve their problems efficiently, these users will find another program that can. Because of this, it is always important to keep the user in mind when developing applications. The client desired to have the app be compatible with multiple devices and multiple web browsers with a client-server based architecture. This was implemented through an interface that could determine who could perform certain actions or retrieve specific data based on their assigned role. 

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

Essentially I tried to look at how each component/part of the system interacted with the whole system itself. I always tried to focus on the overall goal of the software as well as the requirements of the client. That is something I will continue doing for future projects. One thing I've learned through designing software is that there is no such thing as the perfect plan. Unexpected issues will come up and the tasks may be more complex and/or take more time than originally expected. In the future I will work on adding an extra buffer of time to my planning in order to account for these events. With more practice, I should get better at this planning phase and the overall process will be more efficient in the future.
